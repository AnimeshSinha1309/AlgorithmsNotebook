\section{Some interesting types of Flows}

\subsection{Circulation Flows}

When there is no source, but we need to find if there exists a valid cyclic flow in a graph with directed edges with minimum and maximum capacities. The flow through each pipe has to be more than minimum and less than maximum.



\section{Chains in Posets}

A Poset (Partially Ordered Set) is a set where $<$, $=$, $>$ are defined between some pair of elements but not over others. A subset where comparators are defined between every pair is called a chain, where none is defined is called an anti-chain.

\begin{theorem}[Dilworth's Theorem]{}
    The maximum length of any anti-chain in a poset equals the number of chains in it's minimal chain cover.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Koenig's Theorem]{}
    The minimum set cover of a bipartite graph equals the maximum flow from one set to the other.
\end{theorem}
