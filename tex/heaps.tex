\subsection{Basic Operations}

\paragraph{Heapification}
A \textbf{O(n)} algorithm exists for Heapification. It uses the standard sift-down procedure, but starts by correcting the lowest layers first. So start at the end of the array and move back.

\paragraph{Insert}
A \textbf{O(log n)} algorithm is used to insert. We push the element at the end of the array and sift-up or sift-down the element till the element is at a valid locale. 

\paragraph{Delete}
For a \textbf{O(log n)} deletion algorithm, we must swap the last element with the element to be deleted, sift-up/down the former last element, and pop-out the last element.
