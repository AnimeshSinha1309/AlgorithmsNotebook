# Status of Testing

## Completely Tested Methods

* Graph Class
  * Floyd Warshall - Has been tested both for distances and negative loop

## Partially Tested Methods

* Graph Class
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm - Has been tested for outputting correct distances, not for correct path
  * Bellman Ford's Algorithm - Has been tested for outputting correct distances, not for correct path

## In the Test Queue

A lot of methods will be added, when we are close to finishing up, we will add all the new methods here.
